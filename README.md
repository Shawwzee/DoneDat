DoneDat - To-do list app by Shawn Sutton

A simple to-do list app using HTML, CSS and Javascript, I made this app as a beginner project to learn more about event handlers and manipulating the DOM, I will add more functionality down the line like saving activities to memory as well as separate lists for completed tasks and tasks that have yet to be completed.

Feel free to suggest any changes, I'm new to this and looking to learn more!

Changes:
- V1.01 - 14/03/2021 - Added completed list so users can mark when they've completed a task.
